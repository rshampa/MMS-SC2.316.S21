# Molecular Modelling and Simulations

This graduate-level course titled "Molecular Modelling and Simulations" was given in the Spring semester 2021 at IIIT Hyderabad. This course offers an overview on conventional computational chemistry methods which are particularly applied for modelling of molecules and materials.

This repository contains lecture slides from the 2nd part of lecture series given by me (the 1st part was given by Prof. U. Deva Priyakumar.

My part was outlined with the following modules:

## Potential energy functions

 - Bonded and nonbonded interactions
 - Derivatives of molecular mechanics energy functions

## Simulating finite systems

 - Periodic boundary conditions
 - Cutoffs

## Molecular dynamics

 - Integration algorithms
 - Sampling from ensembles
 - Computing properties
 - Calculating free energies

Many thanks to [Prof. Jay Ponder](https://dasher.wustl.edu) for his inspiring lecture materials.
